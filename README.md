# KoNote Web

A secure, web-based client outcome management system for nonprofits. Agencies define desired outcomes with clients, record progress notes with metrics, and visualise progress over time. Each organisation runs their own instance with full control over configuration, terminology, and user access.

---

## Origins & Acknowledgements

**KoNote Web** is based on [KoNote](https://github.com/LogicalOutcomes/KoNote) — an open-source outcome tracking system created by **Dr. David Gotlib** and maintained by [LogicalOutcomes](https://github.com/LogicalOutcomes), a Canadian nonprofit focused on evaluation consulting and building organisational learning capacity.

The original KoNote was designed to help mental health professionals and social service agencies track client outcomes — "notes that count." As Dr. Gotlib put it, traditional EMRs are often "over-engineered and cluttered." KoNote took the opposite approach: a simple interface designed for frontline workers, not IT departments.

### Why This Reconfiguration?

The vision of the original KoNote was always for individual organisations to run their own instances, customised to their specific needs. However, setting up and maintaining custom software has historically required significant technical expertise.

**AI-assisted development has changed this.** Tools like Claude Code make it practical for small nonprofits to:

- Deploy and maintain their own secure infrastructure
- Customise terminology, workflows, and reports to match their practice
- Extend functionality without hiring a development team
- Keep client data under their own control

KoNote Web is a ground-up reimplementation using modern Python/Django, designed specifically for this kind of AI-assisted customisation. The codebase prioritises:

- **Simplicity** — no complex JavaScript frameworks; plain Django templates + HTMX
- **Readability** — clear code structure that AI assistants can understand and modify
- **Security** — encryption at rest, audit logging, role-based access control
- **Compliance** — built with PIPEDA, GDPR, and healthcare regulations in mind

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Django 5.1, Python 3.12 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (dual: app + audit) |
| Frontend | Django Templates, HTMX, Pico CSS |
| Charts | Chart.js |

## Quick Start

> **Not a developer?** That's fine. If you've installed WordPress or used Excel competently, you can set up KoNote. Our [Deploying KoNote](docs/deploying-konote.md) guide explains every step in plain language.
>
> **Important:** Running your own instance means taking responsibility for client data security. KoNote has strong protections built in, but you need to configure them correctly. See the [security responsibility section](docs/deploying-konote.md#understanding-your-responsibility) to understand what that involves.

### Try It Instantly (Docker)

Want to see KoNote before committing to a full setup? Run the demo with one command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

> **Warning:** Demo mode uses default keys and is NOT SECURE. Do not enter real client data. For production, see the full setup below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/konote-web.git
   cd konote-web
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create environment file**

   Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env   # Windows
   # cp .env.example .env   # macOS/Linux
   ```

   Generate required security keys:
   ```bash
   # Generate SECRET_KEY (Django sessions)
   python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

   # Generate FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY (PII encryption - REQUIRED)
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

   Paste both keys into your `.env` file:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=paste-your-generated-key-here
   FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=paste-your-generated-key-here
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://konote:password@localhost:5432/konote
   AUDIT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://audit_writer:password@localhost:5432/konote_audit
   AUTH_MODE=local
   ```

   > **Getting `konote.E001` error?** Your encryption key is missing or invalid.
   > See [Deploying KoNote](docs/deploying-konote.md#troubleshooting) for help.

5. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py migrate --database=audit
   ```

6. **Create admin user**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.
