# Project Tasks

## Flagged

### Pre-existing Test Failures (4 tests)

Not from UX fixes — from earlier "interaction types" redesign and custom fields save issue.

- [ ] Fix French note filter tests — tests expect old note_type filter ("Notes rapides", "Tous les types") but template now uses interaction types (TESTFIX1)
- [ ] Fix custom field save tests — `test_custom_fields_save_htmx_returns_display_partial` and `test_receptionist_can_save_editable_fields` not saving values (TESTFIX2)

## Active Work

### Pre-Launch Checklist

The core app is feature-complete. These tasks prepare for production use.

- [ ] Verify email is configured — needed for export notifications, erasure alerts, and password resets (OPS3)
- [ ] Run full integration test pass — every role, every workflow (TEST3)
- [ ] Test backup restore from a real database dump (OPS4)
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment end-to-end with production-like config (OPS5)

### Occasional Tasks

- [ ] Run UX walkthrough — `pytest tests/ux_walkthrough/ -v`, review report at `tasks/ux-review-latest.md` (UX-WALK1)


## Coming Up

### Review Follow-ups (from 2026-02-05 session review)

_All items completed — see Recently Done._

### Export Monitoring

Weekly accountability reports for admins. Requires working email configuration.

- [ ] Create weekly export summary email command (EXP2u)
- [ ] Document cron/scheduled task setup in runbook (EXP2w)

### Independent Code Review

- [ ] Get independent code review from a third-party tool — e.g. Jules (jules.google.com) or GPT Codex — especially for security (SEC-REV1)

## Roadmap — Future Extensions

### Phase G: Agency Content Translation

Build when agencies have custom programs/metrics they need in multiple languages. See `tasks/multilingual-strategy.md`.

**G.1: Translation Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create TranslatableMixin with `translations` JSONField (I18N10)
- [ ] Add mixin to Program, MetricDefinition, PlanTemplate (I18N11)
- [ ] Create Settings → Translations admin page (I18N12)
- [ ] Update templates to display translated content (I18N13)

**G.2: AI Translation Integration**
- [ ] Create Settings → Integrations page for API keys (I18N14)
- [ ] Add "Suggest translation" button with AI (I18N15)

**G.3: Self-Service Languages**
- [ ] Create Settings → Languages management page (I18N16)
- [ ] Extend translation command for any target language (I18N17)

### Bulk Import

Build after secure export is stable. See `tasks/secure-export-import-plan.md` for design.

- [ ] Create ImportBatch model for tracking (IMP1a)
- [ ] Add import_batch FK to ClientFile model (IMP1b)
- [ ] Create CSV upload form with validation (IMP1c)
- [ ] Implement formula injection sanitisation (IMP1d)
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection (IMP1e)
- [ ] Create preview page showing what will be created (IMP1f)
- [ ] Implement batch import with transaction wrapping (IMP1g)
- [ ] Create rollback functionality — creations only, not updates (IMP1h)
- [ ] Add audit logging for imports (IMP1i)
- [ ] Create import history page for admins (IMP1j)
- [ ] Document import validation rules (DOC-IMP1)

### Other Planned Extensions

- [ ] Field data collection integrations — KoBoToolbox, Forms, or other tools (FIELD1)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- ~~Calendar/scheduling~~ → Recommend Calendly, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- ~~Full document storage~~ → Recommend Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox
- ~~Offline PWA~~ → Paper forms acceptable; integrations available when needed
- ~~Multi-tenancy~~ → Fork required for coalition implementations

## Parking Lot

### Erasure — Deferred Execution for Tier 3

- [ ] Add 24-hour delay before Tier 3 (full erasure) CASCADE delete executes — requires background task scheduler, see `tasks/erasure-hardening.md` section ERASE-H8 (ERASE-H8)

### Deployment Workflow Enhancements

- [ ] Create Demo Account Directory page in admin settings (DEMO9)
- [ ] Add `is_demo_context` to audit log entries (DEMO12)

See [deployment workflow design](docs/plans/2026-02-05-deployment-workflow-design.md) for full details.

### Database Terminology Cleanup

- [ ] Replace 'receptionist' and 'counsellor' with current role names in database migrations — do this the next time a migration is needed to avoid a standalone migration (DB-TERM1)

### UX Accessibility (low priority info items)

- [ ] Add `aria-describedby` linking for quick note form error on `interaction_type` field (UX-A11Y1)
- [ ] Investigate "Note" button not found on Direct Service client detail — may be by design (UX-A11Y2)

### Privacy & Security

- [ ] First-run setup wizard — guided initial configuration (SETUP1)
- [ ] Encrypted search optimisation (search hash field) for 2000+ client lists (PERF1)
- [ ] Bulk operations for discharge, assign (UX17)
