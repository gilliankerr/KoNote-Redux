## Roadmap — Prioritized Extensions

Based on usability review and expert panel analysis. See `tasks/usability-review-results.md` for full rationale.

### Phase A: Market Access (High Priority)

- [ ] French UI translation — Django i18n setup + ~500 strings — (I18N1)
- [ ] Document Link field on client records — URL + title + document type — (DOC5)
- [ ] "What KoNote Is and Isn't" documentation page — set scope expectations — (DOC6)
- [ ] Terminology override by language — extend model for fr/en terms — (I18N2)

### Phase B: Funder Reporting (High Priority)

- [ ] Report aggregation functions — count, avg, min, max by grouping — (RPT3)
- [ ] Demographic grouping in reports — age range, gender, geography — (RPT4)
- [ ] Outcome achievement rate calculation — % clients meeting target — (RPT5)
- [ ] United Way CMT export template — pre-built format — (RPT6)
- [ ] Fiscal year date range filter — April-March for Canadian nonprofits — (RPT7)

### Phase C: Field Data Collection (Medium Priority)

- [ ] KoBoToolbox import API endpoint — POST /api/field-import/ — (FIELD1)
- [ ] SharePoint Lists webhook receiver — Power Automate integration — (FIELD2)
- [ ] Field data import documentation — setup guides for KoBoToolbox/SharePoint — (DOC7)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

These features are intentionally excluded. See technical documentation for rationale.

- ~~Calendar/scheduling~~ → Recommend Calendly, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- ~~Full document storage~~ → Recommend Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox
- ~~Offline PWA~~ → Use KoBoToolbox or paper forms for field work
- ~~Multi-tenancy~~ → Fork required for coalition implementations

## Parking Lot

- [ ] PIPEDA/PHIPA consent workflow — block note entry until client consent recorded — (PRIV1)
- [ ] GDPR toolkit UI — data export, right to erasure, consent management — (GDPR1)
- [ ] Data import from existing systems (CSV) — (IMP1)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive optimisation pass — (UI1)
- [ ] First-run setup wizard for new instances — (SETUP1)
