## Roadmap — Prioritized Extensions

Based on usability review and expert panel analysis. See `tasks/usability-review-results.md` for full rationale.

### Phase A: Market Access (High Priority)

- [ ] French UI translation — Django i18n setup + ~500 strings — (I18N1)
- [ ] Document folder button — link to client folder in SharePoint/Google Drive — (DOC5) — see `tasks/document-access-plan.md`
- [ ] "What KoNote Is and Isn't" documentation page — set scope expectations — (DOC6)
- [ ] Terminology override by language — extend model for fr/en terms — (I18N2)

### Phase B: Funder Reporting (High Priority)

- [ ] Report aggregation functions — count, avg, min, max by grouping — (RPT3)
- [ ] Demographic grouping in reports — age range, gender, geography — (RPT4)
- [ ] Outcome achievement rate calculation — % clients meeting target — (RPT5)
- [ ] United Way CMT export template — pre-built format — (RPT6)
- [ ] Fiscal year date range filter — April-March for Canadian nonprofits — (RPT7)

### Phase C: Field Data Collection (Medium Priority)

- [ ] KoBoToolbox import API endpoint — POST /api/field-import/ — (FIELD1)
- [ ] SharePoint Lists webhook receiver — Power Automate integration — (FIELD2)
- [ ] Field data import documentation — setup guides for KoBoToolbox/SharePoint — (DOC7)

### Phase D: Self-Service Registration (Medium Priority)

Public sign-up forms for programs — parents register kids for sports, adults sign up for classes. See `tasks/self-service-registration-design.md` for full design.

- [ ] RegistrationLink model — shareable form config per program — (REG1)
- [ ] Public registration form view — mobile-friendly, no login required — (REG2)
- [ ] RegistrationSubmission model — pending entries awaiting review — (REG3)
- [ ] Submission review UI — approve/reject/merge duplicates — (REG4)
- [ ] Auto-approve option — skip staff review for low-risk programs — (REG5)
- [ ] Duplicate detection — match by email/phone, flag for merge — (REG6)
- [ ] Capacity limits and deadlines — close registration when full or past date — (REG7)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

These features are intentionally excluded. See technical documentation for rationale.

- ~~Calendar/scheduling~~ → Recommend Calendly, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- ~~Full document storage~~ → Recommend Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox
- ~~Offline PWA~~ → Use KoBoToolbox or paper forms for field work
- ~~Multi-tenancy~~ → Fork required for coalition implementations

## Parking Lot

- [ ] Mobile-responsive optimisation pass — (UI1)
- [ ] First-run setup wizard for new instances — (SETUP1)
