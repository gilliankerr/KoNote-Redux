# Project Tasks

## Flagged

- [ ] Decide product name — should web version  be called "KoNote" (not "KoNote2"). See `tasks/naming-versioning.md` (NAME1)

## Active Work

### Pre-Launch Checklist

The core app is feature-complete. These tasks prepare for production use.

- [ ] Test backup restore from a real database dump (OPS4)
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment end-to-end with production-like config (OPS5)

### Occasional Tasks

- [ ] Run UX walkthrough — `pytest tests/ux_walkthrough/ -v`, review report at `tasks/ux-review-latest.md` (UX-WALK1)


## Coming Up

### Export Monitoring

Weekly accountability reports for admins. Requires working email configuration.

- [ ] Create weekly export summary email command (EXP2u)
- [ ] Document cron/scheduled task setup in runbook (EXP2w)

- [x] Add Privacy Officer name/email to InstanceSettings and expose in templates (PRIV-FIX2)

### Accessibility Review Fixes (from SEC-REV3)

- [x] Add data table alternatives for Chart.js charts (A11Y-FIX1)
- [x] Add aria-live to session timer + "Extend Session" button (A11Y-FIX2)

## Roadmap — Future Extensions

### Phase G: Agency Content Translation

Build when agencies have custom programs/metrics they need in multiple languages. See `tasks/multilingual-strategy.md`.

**G.1: Translation Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create TranslatableMixin with `translations` JSONField (I18N10)
- [ ] Add mixin to Program, MetricDefinition, PlanTemplate (I18N11)
- [ ] Create Settings → Translations admin page (I18N12)
- [ ] Update templates to display translated content (I18N13)

**G.2: AI Translation Integration**
- [ ] Create Settings → Integrations page for API keys (I18N14)
- [ ] Add "Suggest translation" button with AI (I18N15)

**G.3: Self-Service Languages**
- [ ] Create Settings → Languages management page (I18N16)
- [ ] Extend translation command for any target language (I18N17)

### Bulk Import

Build after secure export is stable. See `tasks/secure-export-import-plan.md` for design.

- [ ] Create ImportBatch model for tracking (IMP1a)
- [ ] Add import_batch FK to ClientFile model (IMP1b)
- [ ] Create CSV upload form with validation (IMP1c)
- [ ] Implement formula injection sanitisation (IMP1d)
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection (IMP1e)
- [ ] Create preview page showing what will be created (IMP1f)
- [ ] Implement batch import with transaction wrapping (IMP1g)
- [ ] Create rollback functionality — creations only, not updates (IMP1h)
- [ ] Add audit logging for imports (IMP1i)
- [ ] Create import history page for admins (IMP1j)
- [ ] Document import validation rules (DOC-IMP1)

### Other Planned Extensions

- [ ] Field data collection integrations — KoBoToolbox, Forms, or other tools (FIELD1)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- ~~Calendar/scheduling~~ → Recommend Calendly, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- ~~Full document storage~~ → Recommend Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox
- ~~Offline PWA~~ → Paper forms acceptable; integrations available when needed
- ~~Multi-tenancy~~ → Fork required for coalition implementations

## Parking Lot

### Translation Hardening

- [x] Fix .mo build process — commit .mo to git, no compilation in Docker, freshness check in validate_translations.py — 2026-02-06 (I18N-FIX1)
- [ ] Wrap 106 unwrapped strings across 10 apps in `_()` and add French translations — see `scripts/check_untranslated.py` for full list (I18N-FIX2)

### Erasure — Deferred Execution for Tier 3

- [ ] Add 24-hour delay before Tier 3 (full erasure) CASCADE delete executes — requires background task scheduler, see `tasks/erasure-hardening.md` section ERASE-H8 (ERASE-H8)

### Deployment Workflow Enhancements

See [deployment workflow design](docs/plans/2026-02-05-deployment-workflow-design.md) for full details.

### Privacy & Security

- [ ] First-run setup wizard — guided initial configuration (SETUP1)
- [ ] Encrypted search optimisation (search hash field) for 2000+ client lists (PERF1)
- [ ] Bulk operations for discharge, assign (UX17)
