# KoNote Design Principles

This document explains the research-based design philosophy behind KoNote, particularly around participant engagement in documentation.

## Documentation as Intervention

KoNote is built on a core principle: **progress notes are part of the service, not administrative overhead**.

Traditional record-keeping treats documentation as something staff do *about* participants, often after the session ends. This creates several problems:

- Staff experience note-writing as a burden disconnected from their real work
- Participants never see what's written about them
- Notes capture only the staff member's perspective
- The therapeutic relationship is interrupted rather than strengthened

KoNote takes a different approach. Documentation happens *with* the participant, captures their voice, and reinforces what was accomplished together.

## The Research Basis

### Feedback-Informed Treatment (FIT)

Research by Scott Miller, Barry Duncan, and colleagues has consistently shown that routinely soliciting client feedback improves outcomes:

- **65% improvement** in outcomes for at-risk cases when clinicians use feedback to guide treatment
- **3.5 times more likely** to achieve reliable change when using feedback systems
- **50% reduction** in dropout rates

The key insight: *the act of asking matters as much as the data collected*. When a staff member asks "How was today's session for you?", it communicates that the participant's perspective matters. This strengthens the therapeutic alliance — and alliance is the strongest predictor of outcomes across all helping professions.

### Collaborative Documentation

Research on collaborative documentation — where staff and participants create records together — shows consistent benefits:

- **82% of clients** found collaborative documentation "helpful" or "very helpful"
- **Significant improvement** in medication adherence and treatment engagement
- **6-8 hours per week saved** by staff who no longer document after sessions
- **Stronger therapeutic alliance** when documentation is transparent

Participants who see their records being created feel more ownership over their own care. They're more likely to remember what was discussed, understand their treatment, and trust decisions made with providers.

### Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM)

Broader research on routine outcome monitoring shows that regularly checking in with participants about their progress yields an approximately **8% improvement** in outcomes over standard care — with even larger effects (20-29%) for participants who aren't progressing well.

However, implementation research also reveals common failure patterns:

- When clinicians see feedback as surveillance rather than support, resistance is high
- Systems that don't provide immediate clinical value become "empty compliance"
- Tools that are too complex see poor adoption

This informed our decision to use a single, open-ended question rather than lengthy rating scales.

## How This Shapes KoNote

### The "One Good Question" Approach

Rather than implementing formal rating scales (which require licensing and training), KoNote uses a single reflective question:

> *"What's one thing you're taking away from today?"*

This approach is:

1. **Brief** — Under a minute to complete, so staff actually do it
2. **Open-ended** — Captures the participant's voice in their own words
3. **Therapeutic** — Asking helps participants articulate and consolidate their learning
4. **Analyzable** — Qualitative responses can be reviewed in aggregate to understand themes

The question works across contexts — counselling, case management, youth programs, sports and recreation — because it focuses on the participant's experience rather than clinical constructs.

### "We Created This Note Together"

The confirmation checkbox has been reframed from consent ("I confirm verbal consent was obtained") to collaboration ("We created this note together").

This isn't just friendlier language. It prompts staff to actually document with the participant present, rather than treating consent as a box to tick before saving.

### Participant-Defined Outcomes

KoNote's outcome tracking is built around goals and targets that the participant helps define. The metrics attached to those targets are then recorded in progress notes — so the data being collected is data the participant cares about.

This differs from systems where funders define metrics and staff collect data on behalf of the organisation. In KoNote, outcome tracking serves the participant's goals first.

## Practical Implications for Staff

### This Isn't Extra Work

If you're used to writing notes after sessions, participant engagement might feel like extra burden. But consider:

- **Documentation happens during the session** — you're not typing alone afterwards
- **You already ask how things went** — now you're recording the answer
- **Better records mean less rework** — notes with participant voice are more defensible and meaningful

Research shows staff who adopt collaborative documentation actually save time overall.

### When It's Not Possible

Some situations don't allow for collaborative documentation:

- Crisis interventions where full engagement isn't appropriate
- Brief check-ins with no time for reflection
- Situations where the participant has left before documentation

That's fine. The participant reflection field is optional. But when it's possible, taking 30 seconds to ask the question and record the response is worth it — for your relationship, for them, and for the record.

### Building the Habit

If this is new to your practice, start small:

1. **Try it once a day** — Pick one session to document together
2. **Work the question into your closing** — "Before we wrap up, what's one thing you're taking away?"
3. **Show them the screen** — Let them see their words going into the record
4. **Notice the reaction** — Most participants respond positively to being asked

Over time, it becomes natural. Documentation stops feeling like paperwork and starts feeling like part of the work.

## For Administrators

### Training Recommendations

When onboarding staff to KoNote, include:

1. **The "why"** — Staff who understand the research basis are more likely to adopt the practice
2. **Live demonstration** — Show what collaborative documentation looks like
3. **Permission to adapt** — The question can be phrased naturally; it doesn't have to be read verbatim
4. **Gradual rollout** — Start with willing early adopters and let them model the practice

### Quality Assurance

You can review participant reflection data to understand:

- Are staff capturing participant voices?
- What themes emerge across participants?
- Are there patterns in how participants describe their experience?

This isn't about compliance checking — it's about learning what's working and where support is needed.

### Customisation

The reflection prompt can be customised through terminology settings if your agency prefers different wording. The key elements to preserve:

- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Focused on the participant's takeaway (not evaluation of the service)
- Brief enough to answer quickly
