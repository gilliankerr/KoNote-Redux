## The Home Page

After logging in, you'll see your **home page**. Here's what's there:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Search bar** | Type a client's name or ID to find them quickly |
| **Stats row** | Active clients, alerts, clients needing attention, notes recorded today |
| **Priority Items** | Clients with active alerts or no notes in 30+ days — check these first |
| **Recently Viewed** | Quick links to clients you've looked at recently |

### The stats explained

- **Active Clients** — How many clients are currently enrolled in your programs
- **Active Alerts** — Clients with safety concerns or crisis flags that need your attention

- **Notes Today** — How many notes have been recorded today across your programs

3. Click a name to open their file.

### Using filters

If you need to narrow down your search:

1. Click **Search filters** below the search bar.
2. Choose from:
   - **Status** — Active, Inactive, or Discharged

## Viewing Client Information

When you open a client's file, you'll see several **tabs**:

| Tab | What you'll find |
|-----|------------------|
| **Info** | Basic information, program enrolments, and custom fields |
| **Notes** | Progress notes timeline — everything recorded about this client |
| **Plan** | Their outcome plan with sections, targets, and metrics |
| **Events** | Discrete events like intake, discharge, hospital visits, crises |
| **Analysis** | Charts showing progress over time |

### Switching between tabs

Click any tab name to switch views. The page updates without a full reload.

### Editing client information

1. On the **Info** tab, click **Edit** (pencil icon) next to the section you want to change.
2. Make your changes.
3. Click **Save**.

**Note:** Some fields may be view-only depending on your role.

## Writing Progress Notes

Progress notes record what happened during your interaction with a client. KoNote2 offers two types:

### Quick Note (for brief updates)

Use this for simple check-ins or short updates.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Quick Note**.
4. Type your note in the text box.
5. Check **We created this note together** to confirm you reviewed it with them.
6. Click **Save**.

### Full Progress Note (for detailed sessions)

Use this when you need to document a structured session with targets and metrics.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Progress Note**.
4. Select **"This note is for..."** — Choose the type that best matches this interaction:
   - **Standard session** — Regular client meetings
   - **Brief check-in** — Quick touchpoints
   - **Phone/text contact** — Remote communication
   - **Crisis intervention** — Safety concerns or urgent situations
   - **Intake assessment** — First meeting with a new client
   - **Case closing** — Discharge and closure
   - **Freeform** — Unstructured note without pre-defined sections
5. Fill in:
   - **Session date** — Defaults to today; change if you're documenting a past session
   - **Target sections** — Select which targets you worked on and enter notes and metric values for each
   - **Summary** — A brief overview of the session (optional)
6. **Capture their reflection** — Ask them the question shown on screen and record their response in their own words.
7. Check **We created this note together**.
8. Click **Save Note**.

**Tip:** You only need to fill in the targets you actually worked on. Leave others blank.

### Why Participant Engagement Matters

You might wonder why KoNote2 prompts you to ask the participant a question and capture their response. There are three good reasons:

1. **It strengthens the relationship.** When you ask "What's one thing you're taking away from today?", you're showing that their perspective matters. This simple act builds trust.

2. **It helps them process.** Articulating what they learned or felt reinforces their own progress. Research shows that people who put their insights into words retain them better.

3. **It makes better records.** Notes that include the participant's own voice are more meaningful than notes written entirely from your perspective. If there's ever a review or audit, their words show genuine engagement.

This isn't extra paperwork — it's turning the last few minutes of your session into something valuable for both of you.

### Tips for Participant Reflection

- **Keep it brief.** Even a single sentence captures their voice: *"I realised I've been too hard on myself."*
- **Use their exact words.** Don't paraphrase — write what they actually said.
- **It's okay if they say little.** Sometimes "I feel a bit better" is all there is, and that's fine.
- **Make it natural.** Work it into the conversation: "Before we wrap up, what's one thing you're taking away from today?"
- **Show them the screen.** When you're comfortable, document together so they see their words going into the record.

### Recording metrics

When writing a full progress note, you'll see metric fields under each target (if your admin has set them up). Common examples:

- **Scale ratings** (1–10) for things like housing stability, mood, or engagement
- **Yes/No** checkboxes for milestone achievements
- **Text** for qualitative observations

Enter values for metrics you observed or discussed during the session.

### Backdating notes

If you're documenting a session that happened earlier:

1. In the progress note form, change the **Session date** to the actual date.
2. The note will appear in the timeline based on that date.

### Cancelling a note

Made a mistake? You can cancel a note within 24 hours:

1. Find the note in the Notes tab.
2. Click **Cancel** (or the cancel icon).
3. Enter a reason (required).
4. Confirm.

The note remains visible but is marked as cancelled.

---

## Recording Events

Events are discrete occurrences that don't need a full note — things like intake, discharge, hospital visits, or crises.

### Add an event

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Event**.
4. Choose the **Event type** from the dropdown.
5. Enter the **Date** (defaults to today).
6. Add any **Notes** about the event.
7. Click **Save**.

### Create an alert

Alerts flag a client as needing attention. Use them for safety concerns or urgent follow-ups.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Alert**.
4. Describe the concern.
5. Click **Save**.

The client will appear in the **Priority Items** section of your home page until the alert is resolved.

### Resolve an alert

1. Find the alert in the Events tab.
2. Click **Resolve** or **Cancel Alert**.
3. Add a resolution note.
4. Save.

## Viewing the Outcome Plan

The **Plan** tab shows the client's outcome plan — their goals, targets, and how they're progressing.

### Understanding the plan structure

- **Sections** — Broad categories like "Housing", "Employment", "Health"
- **Targets** — Specific goals within each section (e.g., "Maintain stable housing for 3 months")
- **Metrics** — Measurable indicators attached to targets (e.g., a 1–10 stability scale)

### Viewing target history

1. Click a target name to expand it.
2. You'll see all notes and metric recordings related to that target.
3. Charts show progress over time (if metrics have been recorded).

### Can I edit the plan?

Staff can view plans but typically cannot edit them. Plan changes are made by program coordinators or admins. If something needs updating, let your supervisor know.

## Outcome Insights

Outcome Insights shows you the bigger picture — patterns across all participants in a programme.

### Viewing programme insights

1. Click **Insights** in the main navigation.
2. Choose a **Programme** and a **Time period** (3, 6, or 12 months).
3. Click **Show Insights**.

You'll see:

- **Progress Trend** — A chart showing how progress descriptors are changing month by month
- **Progress Snapshot** — Where participants are right now (Good place, Shifting, Holding, Harder)
- **Engagement** — How people are showing up in sessions
- **What participants are saying** — Anonymous quotes from progress notes, with goal context

This helps you spot patterns: Are people generally moving forward? Is a particular programme area seeing more struggle? What themes come up in participants' own words?

### Client-level insights

You can also see insights for one person:

1. Open their file.
2. Go to the **Analysis** tab.
3. Scroll down to **Qualitative Insights**.

This shows their personal trend and quotes over time.

### AI report summaries (if enabled)

If your admin has turned on AI assistance, you'll see a **Draft report summary** button. This generates a narrative paragraph you can use as a starting point for reports.

**Always review the draft.** It's a first pass, not a finished product. The AI never sees participant names — all identifying information is scrubbed before anything is sent.
