## The Home Page

After logging in, you'll see your **home page**. Here's what's there:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Search bar** | Type a client's name or ID to find them quickly |

Click **View All** next to the search bar to see a paginated list of all clients you have access to.

---

## Viewing Client Information

When you open a client's file, you'll see several **tabs**:

| Tab | What you'll find |
|-----|------------------|
| **Info** | Basic information, program enrolments, and custom fields |
| **Notes** | Progress notes timeline — everything recorded about this client |
| **Plan** | Their outcome plan with sections, targets, and metrics |
| **Events** | Discrete events like intake, discharge, hospital visits, crises |
| **Communications** | Communication history — phone calls, emails, texts, in-person contacts |
| **Analysis** | Charts showing progress over time |

### Switching between tabs

Click any tab name to switch views. The page updates without a full reload.

### Editing client information

1. On the **Info** tab, click **Edit** (pencil icon) next to the section you want to change.
2. Make your changes.
3. Click **Save**.

**Note:** Some fields may be view-only depending on your role.

---

## Writing Progress Notes

Progress notes record what happened during your interaction with a client. KoNote offers two types:

### Quick Note (for brief updates)

Use this for simple check-ins or short updates.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Quick Note**.
4. Type your note in the text box.
5. Check **We created this note together** to confirm you reviewed it with them.
6. Click **Save**.

### Full Progress Note (for detailed sessions)

Use this when you need to document a structured session with targets and metrics.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Progress Note**.
4. Select **"This note is for..."** — Choose the type that best matches this interaction:
   - **Standard session** — Regular client meetings
   - **Brief check-in** — Quick touchpoints
   - **Phone/text contact** — Remote communication
   - **Crisis intervention** — Safety concerns or urgent situations
   - **Intake assessment** — First meeting with a new client
   - **Case closing** — Discharge and closure
   - **Freeform** — Unstructured note without pre-defined sections
5. Fill in:
   - **Session date** — Defaults to today; change if you're documenting a past session
   - **Target sections** — Select which targets you worked on and enter notes and metric values for each
   - **Summary** — A brief overview of the session (optional)
6. **Capture their reflection** — Ask them the question shown on screen and record their response in their own words.
7. Check **We created this note together**.
8. Click **Save Note**.

**Tip:** You only need to fill in the targets you actually worked on. Leave others blank.

### Why Participant Engagement Matters

You might wonder why KoNote prompts you to ask the participant a question and capture their response. There are three good reasons:

1. **It strengthens the relationship.** When you ask "What's one thing you're taking away from today?", you're showing that their perspective matters. This simple act builds trust.

2. **It helps them process.** Articulating what they learned or felt reinforces their own progress. Research shows that people who put their insights into words retain them better.

3. **It makes better records.** Notes that include the participant's own voice are more meaningful than notes written entirely from your perspective. If there's ever a review or audit, their words show genuine engagement.

This isn't extra paperwork — it's turning the last few minutes of your session into something valuable for both of you.

### Tips for Participant Reflection

- **Keep it brief.** Even a single sentence captures their voice: *"I realised I've been too hard on myself."*
- **Use their exact words.** Don't paraphrase — write what they actually said.
- **It's okay if they say little.** Sometimes "I feel a bit better" is all there is, and that's fine.
- **Make it natural.** Work it into the conversation: "Before we wrap up, what's one thing you're taking away from today?"
- **Show them the screen.** When you're comfortable, document together so they see their words going into the record.

### Recording metrics

When writing a full progress note, you'll see metric fields under each target (if your admin has set them up). Common examples:

- **Scale ratings** (1–10) for things like housing stability, mood, or engagement
- **Yes/No** checkboxes for milestone achievements
- **Text** for qualitative observations

Enter values for metrics you observed or discussed during the session.

### Backdating notes

If you're documenting a session that happened earlier:

1. In the progress note form, change the **Session date** to the actual date.
2. The note will appear in the timeline based on that date.

### Cancelling a note

Made a mistake? You can cancel a note within 24 hours:

1. Find the note in the Notes tab.
2. Click **Cancel** (or the cancel icon).
3. Enter a reason (required).
4. Confirm.

The note remains visible but is marked as cancelled.

---

## Recording Events

Events are discrete occurrences that don't need a full note — things like intake, discharge, hospital visits, or crises.

### Add an event

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Event**.
4. Choose the **Event type** from the dropdown.
5. Enter the **Date** (defaults to today).
6. Add any **Notes** about the event.
7. Click **Save**.

### Create an alert

Alerts flag a client as needing attention. Use them for safety concerns or urgent follow-ups.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Alert**.
4. Describe the concern.
5. Click **Save**.

The client will appear in the **Priority Items** section of your home page until the alert is resolved.

### Resolve an alert

1. Find the alert in the Events tab.
2. Click **Resolve** or **Cancel Alert**.
3. Add a resolution note.
4. Save.

### Recommend alert cancellation

Alerts use a **two-person safety rule** — staff recommend cancellation, and a program manager reviews the recommendation before the alert is actually removed.

1. Find the alert in the **Events** tab.
2. Click **Recommend Cancellation**.
3. Write your assessment of why the alert should be cancelled.
4. Click **Submit** — the recommendation is sent to your program manager for review.

If the program manager approves, the alert is cancelled. If they reject it, the alert stays active and you can re-recommend later with new information.

---

## Logging Communications

Communications record all client interactions — phone calls, emails, text messages, and in-person conversations. They appear on the client timeline alongside events and progress notes, giving everyone a complete picture of contact with the client.

### Quick-log (two clicks)

The fastest way to record a communication:

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click the channel button for the type of contact: **Phone**, **Email**, **SMS**, or **In Person**.
4. The direction is set automatically — phone defaults to inbound, email and SMS default to outbound. One click logs the communication.

That's it. The entry is saved to the client's timeline immediately.

### Full communication form

Use this when you need to capture more detail:

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **Log Communication**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Channel** — Phone, Email, SMS, or In Person
   - **Direction** — Toggle between **Inbound** (they contacted you) and **Outbound** (you contacted them)
   - **Subject** — A brief description of what the communication was about (optional)
   - **Content** — Details of the conversation (optional)
5. Click **Save**.

**Tip:** If messaging features are enabled for your agency and the client has consented to receive messages, you may also see a **Send Reminder** option on scheduled meetings.

---

## Scheduling Meetings

Meetings let you schedule and track appointments with clients.

### Create a meeting

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Meeting**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Date and time** — When the meeting will take place
   - **Location** — Where you'll meet (optional)
5. You are automatically added as an attendee.
6. Click **Save**.

### Meeting statuses

Each meeting has a status you can update as things change:

- **Scheduled** — The meeting is coming up
- **Completed** — The meeting happened as planned
- **Cancelled** — The meeting was called off
- **No Show** — The client did not attend

To change a status, open the meeting and use the **Status** dropdown.

### View all your meetings

1. Click **Meetings** in the main navigation.
2. Upcoming meetings appear at the top; past meetings are listed below.

### Sending reminders

If SMS or email messaging is enabled for your agency and the client has given consent, you can send a reminder directly from a scheduled meeting. Open the meeting and click **Send Reminder**.

---

## Using the Calendar Feed

You can subscribe to your KoNote meetings in Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any app that supports iCal feeds. New meetings appear automatically, and cancelled ones disappear — no manual updates needed.

### Set up your calendar feed

1. Click **Meetings** in the main navigation.
2. Click **Calendar Feed Settings**.
3. Click **Generate Feed URL**.
4. Copy the URL.
5. In your calendar app, add a new **subscription** or **iCal feed** and paste the URL.

Your KoNote meetings will now appear in your calendar and stay in sync.

### Privacy

Calendar entries show **initials and record ID only** — not full client names. This keeps information private even if someone else sees your calendar.

### Regenerating the URL

If you need to revoke access to your feed (for example, if you shared the URL accidentally):

1. Go to **Meetings** → **Calendar Feed Settings**.
2. Click **Regenerate Feed URL**.
3. Copy the new URL and update your calendar subscription.

The old URL will stop working immediately.

---

## Viewing the Outcome Plan

The **Plan** tab shows the client's outcome plan — their goals, targets, and how they're progressing.

### Understanding the plan structure

- **Sections** — Broad categories like "Housing", "Employment", "Health"
- **Targets** — Specific goals within each section (e.g., "Maintain stable housing for 3 months")
- **Metrics** — Measurable indicators attached to targets (e.g., a 1–10 stability scale)

### Viewing target history

1. Click a target name to expand it.
2. You'll see all notes and metric recordings related to that target.
3. Charts show progress over time (if metrics have been recorded).

### Can I edit the plan?

Staff can view plans but typically cannot edit them. Plan changes are made by program coordinators or admins. If something needs updating, let your supervisor know.

---

## Outcome Insights

Outcome Insights shows you the bigger picture — patterns across all participants in a program.

### Viewing program insights

1. Click **Insights** in the main navigation.
2. Choose a **Program** and a **Time period** (3, 6, or 12 months).
3. Click **Show Insights**.

You'll see:

- **Progress Trend** — A chart showing how progress descriptors are changing month by month
- **Progress Snapshot** — Where participants are right now (Good place, Shifting, Holding, Harder)
- **Engagement** — How people are showing up in sessions
- **What participants are saying** — Anonymous quotes from progress notes, with goal context

This helps you spot patterns: Are people generally moving forward? Is a particular program area seeing more struggle? What themes come up in participants' own words?

### Client-level insights

You can also see insights for one person:

1. Open their file.
2. Go to the **Analysis** tab.
3. Scroll down to **Qualitative Insights**.

This shows their personal trend and quotes over time.

### AI report summaries (if enabled)

If your admin has turned on AI assistance, you'll see a **Draft report summary** button. This generates a narrative paragraph you can use as a starting point for reports.

**Always review the draft.** It's a first pass, not a finished product. The AI never sees participant names — all identifying information is scrubbed before anything is sent.
