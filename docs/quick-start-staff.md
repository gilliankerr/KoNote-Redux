|-----|------------------|

2. Make your changes.
3. Click **Save**.

**Note:** Some fields may be view-only depending on your role.

## Writing Progress Notes

Progress notes record what happened during your interaction with a client. KoNote offers two types:

### Quick Note (for brief updates)

Use this for simple check-ins or short updates.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Quick Note**.
4. Type your note in the text box.
5. (Optional) Check **Verbal consent obtained** if the client agreed to the note.
6. Click **Save**.

### Full Progress Note (for detailed sessions)

Use this when you need to document a structured session with targets and metrics.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Notes** tab.
3. Click **+ Progress Note**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Session date** — Defaults to today; change if you're documenting a past session
   - **Summary** — A brief overview of the session
   - **Target sections** — For each plan target, add notes about what you discussed and enter any metric values
5. (Optional) Check **Verbal consent obtained**.
6. Click **Save Note**.

**Tip:** You only need to fill in the targets you actually worked on. Leave others blank.

### Recording metrics

When writing a full progress note, you'll see metric fields under each target (if your admin has set them up). Common examples:

- **Scale ratings** (1–10) for things like housing stability, mood, or engagement
- **Yes/No** checkboxes for milestone achievements
- **Text** for qualitative observations

Enter values for metrics you observed or discussed during the session.

### Backdating notes

If you're documenting a session that happened earlier:

1. In the progress note form, change the **Session date** to the actual date.
2. The note will appear in the timeline based on that date.

### Cancelling a note

Made a mistake? You can cancel a note within 24 hours:

1. Find the note in the Notes tab.
2. Click **Cancel** (or the cancel icon).
3. Enter a reason (required).
4. Confirm.

The note remains visible but is marked as cancelled.

## Recording Events

Events are discrete occurrences that don't need a full note — things like intake, discharge, hospital visits, or crises.

### Add an event

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Event**.
4. Choose the **Event type** from the dropdown.
5. Enter the **Date** (defaults to today).
6. Add any **Notes** about the event.
7. Click **Save**.

### Create an alert

Alerts flag a client as needing attention. Use them for safety concerns or urgent follow-ups.

1. Open the client's file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click **+ New Alert**.
4. Describe the concern.
5. Click **Save**.

The client will appear in the **Priority Items** section of your home page until the alert is resolved.

### Resolve an alert

1. Find the alert in the Events tab.
2. Click **Resolve** or **Cancel Alert**.
3. Add a resolution note.
4. Save.

## Viewing the Outcome Plan

The **Plan** tab shows the client's outcome plan — their goals, targets, and how they're progressing.

### Understanding the plan structure

- **Sections** — Broad categories like "Housing", "Employment", "Health"
- **Targets** — Specific goals within each section (e.g., "Maintain stable housing for 3 months")
- **Metrics** — Measurable indicators attached to targets (e.g., a 1–10 stability scale)

### Viewing target history

1. Click a target name to expand it.
2. You'll see all notes and metric recordings related to that target.
3. Charts show progress over time (if metrics have been recorded).

### Can I edit the plan?

Staff can view plans but typically cannot edit them. Plan changes are made by program coordinators or admins. If something needs updating, let your supervisor know.
