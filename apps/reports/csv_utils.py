"""CSV and filename sanitisation utilities for export views.

CSV injection (aka formula injection) occurs when a cell value starts with
characters that spreadsheet applications interpret as formulas: = + - @
An attacker could inject malicious payloads via client names, notes, or
custom field values.

Mitigation: prefix dangerous values with a tab character so Excel/LibreOffice
treat them as plain text rather than formulas.

Filename sanitisation strips characters that could be used for path traversal
or header injection in Content-Disposition headers.
